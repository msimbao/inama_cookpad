# Inama CookPad

A Simple App built with firebase to house traditional Zambian Recipes. Traditional Zambian recipes have not been consistently available online might be reducing in number as the country becomes more westernised. 
Wehn i was younger, i made an android app to address this then later upgraded to a php api. This newest collection is built using firebase and bootstrap to make it cross compatible for mobiles and computers.
